        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>We make this at least once a month and always make sure there is leftover broth to freeze for another day. 
            While it takes a bit of time, most of that is hands-off, so letâ€™s get going towards amazing pho at home, shall we?</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <h4>Broth</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 to 6 pounds of beef knuckles or leg bones</li>
                    <li>6 quarts cold water</li>
                    <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
                    <li>4-inch piece of fresh ginger, halved lengthwise</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Assembly</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound small dried or fresh noodles</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound raw eye of round, sirloin or tri-tip steak</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add beef bones to a large pot that will hold at least 10 quarts. Then, cover bones with cold water. Place pot onto high heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes. During this time, impurities and foam (or scum) will be released and rise to the top. Drain bones, discarding the water. Then, rinse bones with warm water and scrub stockpot to remove any residue that has stuck to the sides. Add the bones back to the stockpot and cover with 6 quarts of cold water.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, move an oven rack to a high position then turn broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place quartered onions and halved ginger onto baking sheet then broil for 10 to 15 minutes, turning onions and ginger occasionally so that they become charred or browned on all sides.</li>
                <li>Add cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves and the black cardamom pod to a dry frying pan. Place onto low heat and cook, stirring occasionally until fragrant. About 5 minutes. Place toasted spices into a cotton muslin bag/herb sachet or cheesecloth then tie with butchers twine to seal.</li>
